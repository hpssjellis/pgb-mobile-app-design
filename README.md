#Tips and Tricks

1. Do not us IE!

1. When using the Preview button it is a good idea in chrome to load an incognito window as Nitrous will be more stable if you accidentally load a plugin
 

1. Students with issues should be using google. Phonegap and Javascript have an enormous amount of example code on the web.
