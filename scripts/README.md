Advanced scripts for nitrous.io

You should know a bit of linux commands such as:

pwd  (shows where you are)

cd .. (moves up a directory)

cd folderName (moves into the directory)

chmod +x myBashFile.sh  (sets a bash file to be able to be executed by anyone)

ls -la   (shows all files and attributes including hidden files)

./myBashFile.sh   (activates the file)

These scripts should be in the correct folder when you activate them. Good idea to drag them into the main folder for your repository.
