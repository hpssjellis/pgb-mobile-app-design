Advanced scripts for nitrous.io

You should know a bit of linux commands such as:

pwd  (shows where you are)

tab  (auto-completes, type the first few letters, then tab, super useful!)

up arrow  (shows other commands you have tried, also very useful )

cd .. (moves up a directory)

cd folderName (moves into the directory)

chmod -R +x *      (sets all files in the directory to be able to be executed)

chmod +x myBashFile.sh  (sets a bash file to be able to be executed by anyone)

ls -la   (shows all files and attributes including hidden files)

./myBashFile.sh   (activates the file)


These scripts should be in the correct folder when you activate them. Good idea to drag them into the main workspace folder from your repository.
